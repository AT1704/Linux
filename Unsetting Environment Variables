Unsetting Environment Variables


Sometimes, you may need to remove an environment variable. This is done using the unset command.

First, let's check if our MY_ENV_VAR is still set:

echo $MY_ENV_VAR
 Explain Code
You should see the value we set earlier.

To unset (remove) this variable, use the unset command:

unset MY_ENV_VAR
 Explain Code
Verify that the variable has been unset:

echo $MY_ENV_VAR
 Explain Code
You should see no output, indicating that the variable no longer exists.

You can also use the -v option with unset to ensure you're unsetting a variable and not a shell function:

unset -v MY_ENV_VAR
 Explain Code
This will have the same result as just running unset MY_ENV_VAR.

Remember, if you've added the variable to your .zshrc file, it will be recreated the next time you open a terminal or source the .zshrc file.
